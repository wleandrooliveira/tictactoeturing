## 1.3.9 (December 30, 2016)
- Auth middleware: when client makes multiples relay requests with expired token, we only need to refresh token once for those requests.

## 1.3.8 (December 22, 2016)
- Configurable header name for auth middleware #28 (thanks to @tehwalris)
For `auth` middleware added `header` option: name of the HTTP header to pass the token in (default: `'Authorization'`).

## 1.3.7 (December 18, 2016)
- Fix `formatRequestErrors` for Absinthe (GraphQL for Elixir) #27 (thanks to @redjohn)

## 1.3.6 (October 11, 2016)
#### Thanks to @kosmikko for his PR #21
- Catch unhandled promises, (closes #7 Red screen for react-native when network problem occurs).
- Add tests.
- Remove unnecessary wrapping Promise.

## 1.3.5 (October 4, 2016)
- Handle malformed or non existent JSON in response (#20). Thanks to @JonathanUsername
- Return main promise. Thanks to @helfer https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql/pull/99
Returning the main promise will let you do things like time execution and perform some cleanups after the request is processed.

## 1.3.4 (August 29, 2016)
* fix: support `express-graphql@0.5.4`. Thanks @genbit [issue #19](https://github.com/nodkz/react-relay-network-layer/issues/19)

## 1.3.3 (August 5, 2016)
* fix: batch express middleware. It should not call next middleware. Thanks @genbit [issue #13](https://github.com/nodkz/react-relay-network-layer/issues/13)

## 1.3.2 (July 28, 2016)
* fix: gqErrors middleware, it does not display errors for single request (thanks to @jibingeo)

## 1.3.1 (July 12, 2016)
* fix: catch react-native error, when network request fails, eg. offline ([issue #7](https://github.com/nodkz/react-relay-network-layer/issues/7)).

## 1.2.0 (June 21, 2016)
* fix: remove `whatwg-fetch` polyfill, due problem in React Native ([issue #8](https://github.com/nodkz/react-relay-network-layer/issues/8)).

If your client does not have `fetch` global method, you should include polyfill explicitly in you code:
```js
  import 'whatwg-fetch'; // for old browsers
  or
  import 'node-fetch';  // for old node versions
  or
  import 'fetch-everywhere'; // fresh isomorphic fetch polyfill, that supports all clients (not tested ;)
```
Thanks to @roman01la and @edvinerikson.
